# ODIN RECIPE

 The current project is about applying what I currently know with HTML side by side with the knowledge from the GitHUb basics. 

 Before I was able to reach this point, I did the following:

 1. Create a new repository entitle odin-recipe
 2. After creating a repository, I cloned the repo into the repos folder. (Make sure you change directories properly so you won't be confused!)
 3. After that, I already created a README.md file and started working on the description which I'm currently doing.

 Honestly, GitHub is foreign to my knowledge so I'm getting confused here and there so before I reached this point and created a proper repo for this project, I spent an hour figuring out stuff just so I can start working on the project. It was hard, but satisfying that I'm able to figure things out.
